The purpose of this work is to explore the potential of generative AIs, in particular those based on the Transformer architecture, to automate the process of summarizing content of documents. The main objective is to study and explore existing open source artificial intelligence (AI) models, with a focus on generative AIs, aiming for the ability to perform analysis, understand context and generate summaries for unstructured documents available on the internet.

For this, we will use encoder-decoder models, following the architecture proposed by the original Transformers (image 1), because text summarization requires a complex mapping between input and output sequences and it is crucial to capture the relationships between elements in both sequences. And encoder-decoder models perform better in this task.
